(1) We need to make button handlers for the button listeners
i.e: ADD: add to the linked list , Remove: remove from the linked list, Check:
See what’s inside the linked list also see if it is empty or not
  - Jeremiah is responsible for the add function
  - Ian is responsible for remove function
  - Sukhdev is responsible for the search and check functions
(2) We need to link the LinkedListGUI.java with out Linked List methods e.g: use the list tester method as a base and link the two
(3) Make sure to screen shot pulling, pushing requests don’t need to screenshot every time just once for our main report
(4) We also have to merge our branches once the changes have been changed
(5) We also need to create an error to make a conflict, refer to the Project Skills CA 3 Word Doc.
